This is what I got when I combined webcam-based gesture recognition with Hakim El Hattab's reveal.js.
It took me a while to write and fine tune the detection algorithms. Even then, the algorithms are only about 80% accurate. You get the gist of it though: 
A flick of the hand in mid-air changes the slide.
A two hand flick up or down activates the slide overview.
